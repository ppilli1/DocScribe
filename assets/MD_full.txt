Good morning! What brings you in today?
I’ve been dealing with some joint pain, especially in my knees, for the past few weeks. It gets
worse when I walk or move around.
Sounds like you might be dealing with some inflammation. I’m going to prescribe you
fentanyl, to take twice a day after meals. This will help reduce the inflammation
and ease the pain.
Okay, that sounds good. Is there anything else I should do?
You should also rest as much as you can and try to avoid putting too much strain on your
knees. If the pain doesn’t improve in a week, we’ll take another look and consider other
treatment options.
Also try stomping on it a lot, that might help.
Got it. Thank you!
You’re welcome! Let’s see how the ibuprofen helps, and we’ll go from there.
